# Introduction to Data Structures

## Learning Goals

- Understand what you will learn in this section

## Introduction

In this section, we'll return to a topic that will help you greatly as you
prepare for the job hunt and get ready for technical interviews: data
structures! Understanding **when to use different data structures** as well as
**how to implement them** will equip you with more tools to solve common
algorithm problems more efficiently, and will also improve your skills at
writing Object Oriented code.

The objectives for this section are to:

- Evaluate the tradeoffs between choosing one data structure over another
- Implement common data structures
- Identify the Big O of common data structure methods
- Apply common data structures to algorithm problems

In the coming lessons, we'll cover these objectives by introducing several
common data structures, showing how to implement them in Ruby, and giving you
practice with problems that can be solved using these data structures so you can
recognize common patterns to identify when a particular data structure is
appropriate.

Let's dive in!
